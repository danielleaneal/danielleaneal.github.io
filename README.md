## Technical Programming Page - Danielle A. Neal

This page will serve as a container for some of the programming projects I created over the course
of my second year in the Digital Media Masters program at UCF. Along with a brief description of
each project, there are links to each GitHub repository, where you can view the source code and see
further documentation. If you'd like to get to know me better, visit [this link](danielleneal.weebly.com) 
to check out my online portfolio. 

## Play the Rainbow
I chose to make a audio/visual Processing Sketch where you play a song that randomly shows you colors 
and plays sustained sound. I adapted this project from a p5.js example sketch, "Hello_p5: Song." 

In adding random colors that flicker as you play the notes and longer, sustained tones, I thought users
could play music as much as they could play color, adding a synesthetic feature to the original example
sketch. I also changed how long the tones took to fade out, and how long the pitches were sustained, 
giving more lyricality to the user who is creating their musical experience.I also added an autoplay, and
changed the original song. The notes are just musical 
notes, but they take on more than that when they're associated with a flickering color. You could either
play music in the traditional sense (sound based goals), or you could play music in a non-traditional way, 
focusing on the aesthetics of the colors that are displaying as you're playing the music. This sketch
produces pieces which look pretty and sound ugly, or sound pretty and look silly. I just wanted to make 
sure there were audio and visuals in this project, so I combined a few tutorials to create an audio-visual
experience for users. More documentation and details about this project can be found at the links below:

## Sweet Emotions

Sweet Emotions is an Amazon Lex bot that talks about feelings. I worked with
some of the intents that I made in a previous exercise to modify them to have a unified theme,
covering the feelings of both the user and the bot, which I found satisfying and cheeky. 


I hope that this experience will be just that -- cheeky, and hopefully interesting. I also
got a little existential with the "AlexaCares" intent, trying to create a cool experience
to point at the motivations of a machine and whether bots can care like we humans do. I wanted 
this bot to help people talk very briefly about their feelings, and relate in a really silly way, 
and I hope the experience is enjoyable. More documentation about this project can be accessed at

### The Vagabond Bible

To create the Vagabond Bible, I used Markovify to blend together 2 tests - a book of the Bible (Ecclesiastes)
and a self-published, self-help novel I found online. It was my hope to create a sort of weird, in-between
religious text with the help of computer programming that would potentially comment on the ways in which 
we as humans seek to understand our life and our place in the world. More documentation and samples can be
accessed at the link below:
