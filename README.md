## Welcome to my Technical Programming Projects Page

This page will serve as a container for some of the programming projects I created over the course
of my second year in the Digital Media Masters program at UCF. Along with a brief description of
each project, there are links to each GitHub repository, where you can view the source code and see
further documentation. 

## Play the Rainbow
I chose to make a audio/visual Processing Sketch where you play a song that randomly shows you colors 
and plays sustained sound. I adapted this project from a p5.js example sketch, "Hello_p5: Song." 

In adding random colors that flicker as you play the notes and longer, sustained tones, I thought users
could play music as much as they could play color, adding a synesthetic feature to the original example
sketch. The notes are just musical notes, but they take on more than that when they're associated with 
a flickering color. You could either play music in the traditional sense (sound based goals), or you 
could play music in a non-traditional way, focusing on the aesthetics of the colors that are displaying 
as you're playing the music. This sketch produces pieces which look pretty and sound ugly, or sound 
pretty and look silly. I just wanted to make sure there were audio and visuals in this project, so I 
combined a few tutorials to create an audio-visualexperience for users.
